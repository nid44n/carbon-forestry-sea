# To what extent does Land Use Change and Forestry contribute to CO₂ emissions across SEA countries? 
Hi there! I am Nidaan, an ESG Data Analyst! 🙌🏻 I used data from the World Bank ESG DataBank and am currently practising my data analysis skills. I'd love to hear any feedback. Thank you and hope you find this insightful!<br /><br />
To answer this, we divide into several questions! <br /> ![Alt text](link) <br />

## 1️⃣Is there a significant correlation between CO₂ emissions from land-use change in forestry (LUCF) and forest area decline across SEA countries? And which country shows the strongest relationship (R²) between the two?

## 2️⃣How does LUCF-based CO₂ emission compare to other sectors (industry, energy, transport, mining) in each country?

## 3️⃣Which countries have the highest CO₂ emissions from LUCF, both in total and as a percentage of their national emissions?

## 📝Conclusions
