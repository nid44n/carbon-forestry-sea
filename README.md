# To what extent does Land Use Change and Forestry contribute to CO₂ emissions across SEA countries? 🌳
Hi there! I am Nidaan, an ESG Data Analyst! 🙌🏻 I used data from the World Bank ESG DataBank and am currently practising my data analysis skills. I'd love to hear any feedback. Thank you and hope you find this insightful!<br /><br />
To answer this, we divide into several questions! <br /> <br />

## 1️⃣How does forest loss, weighted by forest area, influence CO₂ emissions from land-use change across Southeast Asian countries?
First, I cleaned data I extracted from the World Bank using MySQL. After finishing the preprocessing step, I transformed data into Jupyter Notebook to later be processed by Python. Using Random Forest algorithm, I discovered that the feature importance score for the following factors are as follows: <br />

**Tree Cover Loss (hectares) : 91.1%** <br />
**Forest Area (%) : 8.9%** <br />

Notice that tree cover loss has a strong influence in carbon emissions from Land Use Change and Forestry (LUCF) across SEA countries. This could indicate that changes in tree cover, such as deforestration, is the primary cause of carbon emissions in LUCF. However, we need to keep in mind that Tree cover loss is an absolute value whilst forest area is the relative value. One interesting insight we can draw from this is: <br /> 

💡In densely forested countries, small changes in forest area can mean hundreds or thousands of hectares forest lost, resulting in massive carbon emission. Therefore, we need to use data wisely by categorizing tree cover loss based on xxx <br />


## 2️⃣How does LUCF-based CO₂ emission compare to other sectors (industry, energy, transport, mining) in each country?

## 3️⃣Which countries have the highest CO₂ emissions from LUCF, both in total and as a percentage of their national emissions?
